# Sorting Hat

## Pre-requisites
- Install GoLang: https://golang.org/doc/install
- Configure your $GOPATH - Do this wherever you install the file
- If you're having trouble installing, please look up the issue on Stackoverflow.
- Next, install DiscordGO by running this in terminal: go get github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo
- On your Discord server, create 4 new roles: Slytherin, Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, and Ravenclaw and set their colors correctly (Spelling matters!)

## Configuring the Sorting Hat
- There are a few things you will need to configure in the sorting.go file:
- Find "//CONFIG" in sorting.go, it'll be near the top. 
- Follow the steps, DO NOT touch anything it tells you not to. 
- You can find the role IDs by typing: \@Ravenclaw, for example. 
- The Token is to be edited under the main function, and not under //CONFIG! This is your bots token.

## Running Sorting Hat
- To run the bot after configuring:
- go run sorting.go
